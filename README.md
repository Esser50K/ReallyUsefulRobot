## Hardware

CAD files are provided in STEP/STP format. This is the whole assembly as a solid format so you can easily edit it. You will need to load it into some CAD software and edit/export individual STLs for printing.

Tyres are printed in TPU, I used Ninjaflex. The rest in PLA printed with a combination of 0.5mm and 1.2mm nozzles.

Motors are 6374 150Kv BLDC motors from the ODrive store: https://odriverobotics.com/shop
Encoders and cables are the 8192 CPR encoders also from the ODrive store.
I used a 56V ODrive 3.6, the robot runs from a 24V LiPo, but it can be 25V+ when it's charged.
Drive belts are 590mm T5 12mm wide PU belts with steel tensioners made by Synchroflex.
