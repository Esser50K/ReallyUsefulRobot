## Hardware

CAD files are provided in STEP/STP format. This is the whole assembly as a solid format so you can easily edit it. You will need to load it into some CAD software and edit/export individual STLs for printing.

Tyres are printed in TPU, I used Ninjaflex. The rest in PLA printed with a combination of 0.5mm and 1.2mm nozzles.

Motors are 6374 150Kv BLDC motors from the ODrive store: https://odriverobotics.com/shop
Encoders and cables are the 8192 CPR encoders also from the ODrive store.
I used a 56V ODrive 3.6, the robot runs from a 24V LiPo, but it can be 25V+ when it's charged.
Drive belts are 590mm T5 12mm wide PU belts with steel tensioners made by Synchroflex.

Other electronics so far include:

-Teensy 4.1
-NVIDIA Xavier NX
-RPLIDAR A2
-24v and 11.1v lipos, switches and wiring etc

## Software

The Robot runs ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04. This is because the NVIDIA Xavier NX runs 18.04 by default.

On the robot:

The arduino code runs on the Teensy 4.1. This talks to the wheel encoders. It subscribres to the cmd_vel topic and publishes Odom, and TF for the robot's motions. The RPLIDAR A2 node publishes the scan topic: https://github.com/robopeak/rplidar_ros

The Teensy also talks to the ODrive on Serial1. In order to get the ROS Serial library running on the Teensy 4.1, and get both the ROS Serial library and the ODrive library to run together I had to make various modifications. I removed mentions of the Stream Operator which were in the original ODrive Arduino example: https://github.com/madcowswe/ODrive/tree/master/Arduino/ODriveArduino/examples/ I also had to modify the ROS Serial library to add Teensy 4.1 support, and increase buffers so that the Odom message could be published over Serial.

I've included both modified libraries as zip files.
